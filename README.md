# Lab3-Web-Technology

This project was developed as part of assignment 3 of the subject - Web Technology. It was required to clone a web page that had a form in it that consisted of various input fields like name, password, e-mail id, contact number, gender, address, hobbies.
The web page that I had to clone is provided(named as lab3.pdf) along with index.html.

I used various form input elements like text, text area, radio, check box, file and select-option.

To run the project, fork the repository and download it. Then preview the index.html file.
